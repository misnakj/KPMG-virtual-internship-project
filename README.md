# KPMG Virtual Internship Programme

This project was conducted within the framework of the KPMG virtual internship, focusing on the analysis and enhancement of data pertaining to Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. The dataset encompassed crucial information across customer demographics, transactional records, and address data. Throughout the project lifecycle, I executed comprehensive data cleaning procedures utilizing SQL, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the dataset.

Subsequently, I leveraged advanced data visualization techniques to distill meaningful insights from the analyzed data. The observations gleaned were thoughtfully presented, demonstrating a keen ability to communicate complex findings in a clear and compelling manner. This holistic approach not only underscored my proficiency in data management but also highlighted my capacity to derive actionable insights from diverse datasets within a professional setting.
